# Finna Hold Identifier Helper
Display your Finna library Hold Identifier on your Holds page. Really kicks ass
on Firefox mobile.\
Recommended User Script extension: [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

Tested with OUTI Libraries, no reason it shouldn't with other libraries in the
network. Let me know if yours needs a fix of some kind.
